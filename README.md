# Train-Scheduler

### Overview

In this project, I have created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### User

Administrators(users) are able to submit the following:
* Train Name
* Destination 
* First Train Time -- in military time
* Frequency -- in minutes

Users from many different machines will be able to view same train times.
